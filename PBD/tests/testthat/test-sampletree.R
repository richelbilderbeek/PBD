  # - Use PBD:::sampletree
  # - lintr-bot prefers l_table over L

  # Create an L table that can be sampled randomly in two ways

  # Create the two expected L tables

  # 10x: create a randomly sampled L table
  #   - each of these must be one of the two expected L tables

  # Test for those errors explicity.
